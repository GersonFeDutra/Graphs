2. just run [setup.sh](setup.sh);
3. if you are using `gcc` press 0, for `clang` press 1;
- Everything should works fine from here.

### Windows

2. MingW must works fine, you have to compile and link all files contained in [src/](src/) - not
sure what command to use for that, so you might want to google it. You probably will want to use an
IDE like Code::Blocks, just add the files into your project;
3. and run [src/main.c](src/main.c).
